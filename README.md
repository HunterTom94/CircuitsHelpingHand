Quick ways to solve common calculations encountered durin circuit designs.

Currently Only Support Getting Target Resistor Ratio and Resistor Sum When Picking Resistors.

Usage:
1. Use ResistorData to enter information about available resistors.
2. In the RatioResistor.py and SumResistor.py script, change values of variables in the line of asterisk.
3. Run scripts. The result will be printed in the console.
